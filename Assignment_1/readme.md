## Time Complexity ##

**Time Complexity of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: O(n^3)**  

## Analysis ## 
After analysing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, we figured out that this algorithm finds the shortest path between different pairs in a graph and/or a matrix. The algorithm uses dynamic programming to reap out the results. This means that this algrotihm divides the primary problem into various sub-problems. Solving all the sub-problems will bring out the fastest optimal solution. That is why Floyd-Warshall algorithm is one of the most effective algorithms for finding the shortest path of any given graph.
